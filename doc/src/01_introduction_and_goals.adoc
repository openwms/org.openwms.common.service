== Introduction and Goals
The OpenWMS.org Common Service provides essential functionality to deal with `Locations`, `LocationGroups` and `TransportUnits`. An example
often referred to is the ability to move a `TransportUnit` from a `Location` A to a `Location` B. Beside this also other secondary resources
like `TransportUnitTypes` or rulesets like the `PlacingRule` to define what kind of `TransportUnit` can be put on what type of `Location`
are managed by this service.

=== Requirements Overview
The required and demanded functionality of the Common Service is comprised by the issues tracked in GitHub issue tracker. All open issues
that are assigned to an upcoming milestone are accepted for implementation and will likely be implemented and released.

=== Quality Goals

[cols="1,2,3,4,5" options="header"]
|===
| **Priority** | **Characteristic** | **Scenario** | **Activity** | **Risk**
| HIGH | Interoperability | The service must be operated in a service mesh of services of arbitrary technologies | The service API is implemented with HTTP and JSON exchange format | --
| HIGH | Performance | The service must respond in less than 100ms | This needs to be considered with the choice of the persistency mechanism | Scalability: Increasing datasets could have an impact
| MEDIUM | Accessability | The service may run in a multi-tenant environment and all functions must be aware of multi-tenancy | All API functions, services and persistency mechanisms must be aware of the tenant | Performance: With increasing tenants this could have a negative impact on the performance with regarding data isolation
