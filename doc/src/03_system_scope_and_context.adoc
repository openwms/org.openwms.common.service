== System Scope and Context

=== Business Context

The Common Service is a central service used by many other services of the Transport Management (TMS) domain and the Warehouse Management
(WMS) domain. It does not depend on or use other OpenWMS.org services, hence it can be seen as one of the essential base services of each
system.

| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| Common Service | Base service of the COMMON domain responsible to manage `TransportUnits`, `Locations` and `LocationGroups`. Functionality if offered as a REST API over HTTP and an asynchronous command API
| User Interface | A user interface, i.e. for operators, may interact with the Common Service
| Transport Management Services | All services of the automatic and manual transport management may access the Common Service directly
| Warehouse Management Services | All services of the warehouse management domain may interact with the Common Service directly

| **Name** | **Responsibility**
| Location | A `Location`, represents a physical or virtual place in a warehouse. Could be something like a storage location in the stock or a conveyor location. Even error locations can be represented with the `Location`. Multiple Locations with same characteristics are grouped to a `LocationGroup`
| LocationType | A `LocationType` is the type of `Locations` with same characteristics
| LocationGroup | A `LocationGroup` is a logical group of `Locations` with same characteristics
| Target | A `Target` is either a physical or a logical endpoint of any kind of warehouse order. A `TransportOrder` has a `Target` assigned where it has to be moved to
| Account | An `Account` encapsulates identifying information about the actual cost center
| TransportUnit | A `TransportUnit` is an item like a box, a toad, a bin or a pallet that is moved within a warehouse and can carry goods. It can be moved between `Location`s
| TransportUnitType | A `TransportUnitType` is a type of a certain `TransportUnit`. Typically to store characteristic attributes of `TransportUnits`, such as the length, the height, or the weight of `TransportUnits`
| TypeStackingRule | A `TypeStackingRule` is a `Rule` that defines what `TransportUnitType` can be stacked on other types
| TypePlacingRule | A `TypePlacingRule` is a `Rule` that defines what types of `TransportUnits` can be put on what type of `Location`

=== Technical Context
The Technical Context illustrates interfaces (channels and transmission media) linking the system to its environment. In addition a mapping
of domain specific input/output to the channels, i.e. an explanation with I/O uses which channel.

The Common Service exposes several resources over HTTP REST. The current available and detailed interface description can be found https://openwms.github.io/org.openwms.common.service/rest/2.0.0-SNAPSHOT/api.html[here].
In addition, the service sends event notifications out to surrounding services about master data changes and actions that occur within the
service.

It offers an asynchronous API to trigger actions via commands from the outer world.

| **Name** | **Type** | **Responsibility**
| REST API | Synchronous API over HTTP | API to retrieve data from and to trigger actions on the Common domain objects
| common.lg | RabbitMQ Exchange | Outgoing exchange to send events according to changes on `Locations` and `LocationGroups`
| common.tu | RabbitMQ Exchange | Outgoing exchange to send events according to changes on `TransportUnits` and `TransportUnitTypes`
| common.tu.commands | RabbitMQ Exchange | An exchange where the Common Service sends out commands and requests to other services
| common-tu-commands-queue | RabbitMQ Queue | A queue bound to the own exchange to receive incoming commands or responses to sent out requests
